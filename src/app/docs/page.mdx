# Introduction to Consonant

Consonant is a **real-time AI cost enforcement platform** designed for B2B SaaS companies. It sits between your application and AI providers, tracking costs per customer and enforcing spending limits in real-time.

## The Problem We Solve

When you add AI features to your SaaS product, you typically charge customers a flat monthly rate (e.g., $50/user). But AI API costs are **completely variable**—some customers cost 10x or even 100x more than others.

Without Consonant, you discover these "vampire customers" 30 days later when your AI bill arrives. By then, you've already lost money.

## How Consonant Works

1. **Install our SDK** — Wrap your AI client with 3 lines of code
2. **Track automatically** — Every request is attributed to a customer
3. **Enforce limits** — Block requests when customers exceed their budget

```typescript
import { Consonant } from '@consonant/sdk'

const consonant = new Consonant({
  apiKey: process.env.CONSONANT_KEY,
  customerIdExtractor: (ctx) => ctx.userId
})

// Wrap your AI client
const ai = consonant.wrap(openaiClient)

// Now all requests are tracked & enforced
const response = await ai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }]
})
```

## Key Features
